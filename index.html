    <h1 class="intro-text">The Tale of Two Sisters</h1>
    <center><img src="437511.png" width="500px" height="600px"></center>
        <div class="scroll-reveal box left">There were two sisters Polly and Dolly living in a small town of Amsterdam. They never used to fight, and loved each other a lot.
            They studied in the same school, and then got into the same college. 
            They were very happy in their lives.
        </div>
        <div class="scroll-reveal box right">But one day, Dolly got very jealous of Polly when the boy Dolly was crushing on showed interest in Polly instead of her. 
            She was mad at her sister for that, and this dissatisfaction got so bad that she slipped into depression and took her own life afterwards.
        </div>
        <div class="scroll-reveal box top">After several years of Dolly's death, Polly and that guy Joe got married. On their wedding night, Joe was confused after watching Polly 
            drinking cranberry juice as he knew Polly was allergic to cranberry and could never possibly have it intentionally. He got doubtful and went to check her back where she had a birthmark.
        </div>
        <h1 class="loader">Now...</h1>
        <div class="scroll-reveal box bottom">There was no birthmark! It means it was Dolly, not Polly. She actually had killed her sister 5 years ago and took her 
            place in front of everyone. Her anger had made her the murderer of her own sister.
